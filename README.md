# SimCore

This repository is focused on interfacing between the [Geant4](https://github.com/Geant4/geant4) simulation engine and the [Framework](https://github.com/LDMX-Software/Framework) processing framework.

The main support for this interface is the [Simulator](include/SimCore/Simulator.h) class which is a producer creating lots of simulated data for other processors to work on and analyze.
